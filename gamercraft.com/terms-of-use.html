Terms</h3><p>Our platform is designed to deliver the best online competitive and learning gaming experiences, including mobile and web applications (&quot;<strong>Apps</strong>&quot;), and operate a tournament organizing platform (“<strong>Platform</strong>”). Please read these Gamercraft Terms of Service and any applicable App guidelines (and, collectively, “<strong>the Terms</strong>”), because the Terms govern your use of the Apps and Platform. The Terms also govern your interaction with any websites we own or operate (“<strong>Sites</strong>”), purchase of any Gamercraft merchandise, participation in Gamercraft live tournaments, events or promotions (“<strong>Tournament and Events</strong>”), and more generally your use of any Gamercraft products or services (together with Apps and Platform, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).</p><p><br/><br/>Some exceptions to the Terms may apply based on your country of residence - please see the country-specific sections below.<br/><br/>These Terms are entered into between you and Gamercraft, Inc., 7301 SW 57th Ct Suite 525, Miami, FL 33143.<br/><br/>By using the Services, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services. Gamercraft may modify these Terms at any time, and if we do, we will notify you by posting the modified Terms on the Site or in the App. It’s important that you review any modified Terms before you continue using the Services.

If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services.<br/><br/>Games of Chance Disclaimer: Gamercraft creates, organizes, and produces video gaming tournaments, leagues, and other competitive formats in skill-based computer games. The titles we will support are League of Legends, Valorant, Teamfight Tactics, DOTA 2, and CSGO. All of these games are categorized as “Games of skill”, where the outcome of any game, match, or tournament played depends on skills and abilities, not on chance. In other words, games of skill require a physical or mental ability and a learned capacity to carry out a result. These include the use of strategy, tactic, physical coordination, strength, technical expertise, or knowledge. This difference is what makes Gamercraft tournaments legal in the majority of the United States.<br/><br/>SECTION 13 &quot;DISPUTE RESOLUTION&quot; CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. If you are a user in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or any other country that does not allow such arbitration agreement, Section 13 does not apply to you.<br/><br/>If you breach these Terms we may take action against you, including but not limited to terminating your account.

THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN GAMERCRAFT AND YOU.</p><h3>13. Dispute Resolution</h3><p><strong>YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND GAMERCRAFT WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.<br/><br/>THIS NOTICE DOES NOT APPLY: (1) IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE EEA, OR ANY JURISDICTION WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, (2) IF YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AS DESCRIBED IN THE &quot;ARBITRATION&quot; SECTION BELOW, OR (3) TO CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN SECTION 13.1, “ARBITRATION,” BELOW.</strong><br/><br/><em>13.1 Arbitration</em><br/><br/>If you live in the US or another jurisdiction which allows you to agree to arbitration, you and Gamercraft agree that any disputes will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (a) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (b) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (the action described in this clause (b), an &quot;IP Protection Action&quot;). Notwithstanding this arbitration agreement, Gamercraft reserves the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against you to stop and/or seek compensation for the intentional or willful misuse or abuse (e.g. hacking or falsifying location) of its IP, products, and Services.<br/><br/>Without limiting the preceding paragraph, you will also have the right to litigate any other dispute if you provide Gamercraft with written notice of your desire to do so by email to termsofservice@gamercraft.com within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an &quot;Arbitration Opt-out Notice&quot;). If you don’t provide Gamercraft with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above. Further, unless both you and Gamercraft otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this class action waiver is held unenforceable, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms. If the terms of this Section 13.1 “Arbitration” are found unenforceable as to any claim for relief, that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought pursuant to Section 13.6, “Governing Law and Exclusive Venue.” All other claims will be arbitrated. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to its interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation including any claim that all or any part of it is void or voidable.<br/><br/><em>13.2 Arbitration Rules</em><br/><br/>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.<br/><br/><em>13.3 Arbitration Process</em><br/><br/>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration) The single arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.<br/><br/><em>13.4 Arbitration Location and Procedure</em><br/><br/>Unless you and Gamercraft otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in a confidential manner, in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Gamercraft submit to the arbitrator, and there will be no other discovery conducted (such as depositions), unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.<br/><br/><em>13.5 Arbitrator’s Decision</em><br/><br/>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will be treated as confidential, and will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Confirmation and enforcement of the arbitration award may be done in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 12 &quot;Limitation of Liability&quot; as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. Gamercraft will not seek, and hereby waives, all rights it may have under applicable law to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.<br/><br/><em>13.6 Governing Law and Exclusive Venue</em><br/><br/>To the extent that these Terms allow you or Gamercraft to initiate litigation in a court, other than for small claims court actions, both you and Gamercraft agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state of Massachusetts. Each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by the laws of the Massachussets, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules. If you are resident in a member state of the EEA or a country in which this clause is prohibited by local law, this section does not apply to you, and does not deprive you of the protection of the mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws in your country.<br/><br/><em>13.7 Fees</em><br/><br/>Our responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Gamercraft will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11(b)).<br/><br/><em>13.8 Changes to Dispute Resolution</em><br/><br/>Notwithstanding the provisions of the &quot;Changes to Terms or Services&quot; section above, if Gamercraft changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (by email to termsofservice@gamercraft.com) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Gamercraft’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Gamercraft in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).<br/><br/></p><h3>14. General</h3><p><em>14.1 Entire Agreement</em><br/><br/>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Gamercraft and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Gamercraft and you regarding the Services and Content.<br/><br/><em>14.2 Severability</em><br/><br/>If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Gamercraft’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Gamercraft may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction, and the transferor or assignor shall not remain jointly and severally liable. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.<br/><br/><em>14.3 Force Majeure</em><br/><br/>Neither Gamercraft, any user, nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Services or Content shall be liable with respect to any damages, injuries, nonperformance or delay in performance by reason of any act of God, weather, fire, flood, acts of terror or foreign enemy, satellite or network failure, governmental order or regulation, trade dispute,or any other cause beyond its respective control.<br/><br/><em>14.4 Notice</em><br/><br/>Any notices or other communications provided by Gamercraft under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (a) via email; or (b) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted to any email address Your provided.<br/><br/><em>14.5 Waiver</em><br/><br/>Gamercraft’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Gamercraft. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.<br/><br/><em>14.6 Contact Information</em><br/><br/>If you have any questions about these Terms or the Services, please contact Gamercraft at termsofservice@gamercraft.com or 22 Boston Wharf Road 7th Floor, Boston, MA 02210.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="cards-section" class="cards-section-2 wf-section"></section><footer id="footer" class="footer wf-section"><header id="nav" class="navbar-component is--1140"><ul role="list" class="c-nav_footer w-list-unstyled"><li class="c-nav_footer__link"><a href="mailto:team@gamercraft.com" class="c-nav_footer__link-item">Contact</a></li><li class="c-nav_footer__link"><a href="terms-of-use.html" aria-current="page" class="c-nav_footer__link-item w--current">Terms of Use</a></li><li class="c-nav_footer__link"><a href="privacy.html" class="c-nav_footer__link-item">Privacy Policy</a></li><li class="c-nav_footer__link"><a href="partners/program.html" class="c-nav_footer__link-item">Partner Program</a></li><li class="c-nav_footer__link"><a href="careers.html" class="c-nav_footer__link-item">Careers</a></li><li class="c-nav_footer__link"><a href="https://help.gamercraft.com/en/" class="c-nav_footer__link-item">Support</a></li></ul></header><div class="c-nav_footer__copyright w-container"><div class="c-nav_footer__copyright-p">Copyright © 2020 All rights reserved.
